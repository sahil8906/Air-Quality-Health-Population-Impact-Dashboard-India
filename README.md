📊 India’s AQI Insights & Health Impact Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Power BI solution designed to analyze India’s Air Quality Index (AQI) and its impact on public health. It integrates multiple datasets including air pollutants, disease cases, population trends, and vehicle statistics to deliver meaningful, data-driven insights.

The dashboard supports environmental monitoring, policy evaluation, and awareness initiatives through interactive visualizations and advanced analytics.

🎯 Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to:

Monitor air quality trends across states and cities

Analyze the correlation between pollution and health outcomes

Evaluate the impact of transportation and EV adoption

Enable informed decision-making for stakeholders

📂 Dataset Details

The project uses the following datasets:

AQI and Pollutant Data (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)
